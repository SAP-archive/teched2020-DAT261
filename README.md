## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2020 session called DAT261 - Administer and Operate SAP HANA in the Cloud. 

## Overview

This hands-on session provides an end-to-end picture of the operations required for running SAP HANA in the cloud, focusing on day-to-day administration and maintenance topics. Through hands-on exercises, we explore the different tools you can use to analyze and resolve performance and stability issues that are typical of an SAP HANA database running on the SAP HANA Cloud service.

## Requirements

This session assumes that you already have an SAP HANA Cloud Trial account. If that's the case, proceed to Chapter 1.

If you do not have an SAP HANA Cloud Trial account, you can register for free at https://www.sap.com/cmp/td/sap-hana-cloud-trial.html. Once you have successfully registered and your account is set up, perform the following steps:

1. Enter the "trial" subaccount
2. Enter the "dev" space
3. Click "SAP HANA Cloud" from the left navigation bar
4. Click the button "Create Database" in the top right to invoke the Create Instance wizard
5. Enter "TechEd" for the instance name
6. Enter and confirm your administrator password - please remember it!
7. Click the button "Create Instance" at the bottom

A new SAP HANA Cloud instance will be created - this process will take approx. 25 minutes. You may need to refresh the page to see the instance as "Running" (as opposed to "Creating").
